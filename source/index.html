                    <dd class="one-half column">Twelve years design experience spanning identity, visual design and UI/UX. I draw in Illustrator, design interfaces in Sketch, wireframe with Invision, and prototype interactions with Framer. I relish any opportuntiy to work on logos and iconography though it's a small part of my work.<br/><br/>
                    I am a compentant developer with experience in iOS (Objective-C), Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.

Though the tools may change, I've found that a human-centered design process results in high quality products, no matter the medium or industry.<br/><br/>
                    I don't have a traditional work history. For the last three years I've run my own micro-agency that provides marketing and product design services to clients while allowing me to pursue side projects and entrepreneurial efforts.</dd>

It took me six years to graduate because I worked full time through college at a product development consultancy. That’s where I learned how to design, manage teams and ship products.<br><br>I've also attended software development training to increase my technical capabilities.
